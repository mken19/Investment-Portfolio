# Investment Portfolio Research and Modelling

This repository is a personal project focused on the exploration of stock prediction models and portfolio optimization techniques. It serves as a sandbox for developing and evaluating methods from both statistical and machine learning perspectives, as well as applying quantitative finance principles to asset allocation.

## Objectives

- Investigate stock price forecasting using statistical and machine learning models.
- Explore portfolio construction and optimization frameworks.
- Build an applied understanding of quantitative finance through hands-on experimentation and modeling.

## Areas of Exploration

### Stock Prediction Models

**Statistical Methods**
- Linear Regression
- Bayesian Regression
- Time Series Models (e.g., ARIMA)

**Machine Learning Approaches**
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks
- Random Forests and other ensemble methods
- Additional models such as XGBoost, Transformer-based architectures, etc.

### Portfolio Optimization

- Mean-Variance Optimization (Markowitz framework)
- Black-Litterman Model
- Risk Parity
- Multi-factor models and convex optimization techniques

## Status

This is an ongoing and evolving research project. The codebase is actively being updated as new methods are explored and refined. Some components may be in experimental stages and subject to revision.
